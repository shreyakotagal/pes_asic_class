# PES_ASIC_Class
# OBJECTIVE

The objective of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) physical design for ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) is to convert a logical design description known as RTL (Register Transfer Level) into a physical arrangement suitable for fabrication as an integrated circuit. This process entails translating the circuit's abstract functional representation into a tangible implementation that satisfies design limitations, performance objectives, and the prerequisites for manufacturability.

# INSTALLATION

The following link was used to run the steps in the ubuntu terminal: https://github.com/kunalg123/riscv_workshop_collaterals/blob/master/run.sh

Errors that were come across:

```
shreyakotagal@Ubuntu:~/riscv_toolchain/iverilog$ ./configure checking build system type... x86_64-pc-linux-gnu checking host system type... x86_64-pc-linux-gnu checking for gcc... gcc checking whether the C compiler works... no configure: error: in `/home/shreyakotagal/riscv_toolchain/iverilog': configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables See `config.log' for more details
```

Restarting terminal and running the ./configure command again seemed to solve the issue.

# DAY 2

<details> 
<summary> Application Binary Interface (ABI) Overview </summary>

An Application Binary Interface (ABI) constitutes a set of regulations that oversee the arrangement and access of functions, data structures, and system calls within a binary program or library. This framework establishes the fundamental interaction between distinct components of a program or between a program and the operating system. Noteworthy aspects of an ABI encompass:

1. Binary Harmony: ABIs ensure that binary code generated by one compiler or platform can harmonize seamlessly with code produced by another, provided they adhere to the same ABI specifications.

2. Function Calling Protocol: ABIs dictate the protocol for invoking functions, encompassing the sequence and location of arguments and return values, as well as the management of the call stack during function invocations.

3. Register Utilization: ABIs specify which registers are earmarked for specific purposes (e.g., argument passing, return values, temporary storage) and the manner in which they are managed during function calls.

4. Data Arrangement: ABIs outline the arrangement of data structures, such as structs and arrays, in memory, including guidelines for alignment and padding.

5. Exception Handling: They delineate the treatment of exceptions (e.g., hardware or software interrupts), encompassing the transition of control between user code and exception handlers.

6. System Calls: ABIs detail the manner in which programs interact with the operating system via system calls, including the mechanism for passing arguments and retrieving results.

7. Platform Neutrality: ABIs foster compatibility across distinct platforms (e.g., diverse CPU architectures or operating systems) by offering a standardized interface.

8. Dynamic Linking: They address dynamic linking aspects, including the loading and linking of shared libraries (DLLs on Windows or shared objects on Unix-based systems) during runtime.

9. Versioning: Certain ABIs incorporate mechanisms for versioning, enabling future modifications without disrupting compatibility with existing code.

10. Documentation: ABIs are typically documented and published, facilitating developers in crafting code that adheres to the ABI's specifications.

11. Toolchain Support: Compilers and assemblers are designed to produce code in accordance with the ABI, ensuring interoperability among code generated by varied tools.

12. Cross-Platform Development: ABIs hold special significance in cross-platform development, where code must execute on multiple platforms with potentially distinct hardware architectures and operating systems.

13. Security: ABIs may encompass security-related elements, such as safeguards against buffer overflows and stack vulnerabilities.

<summmary> Memory Allocation for Multi-Byte Values </summmary>

Storing a 64-bit number (or any multi-byte value) in memory necessitates awareness of byte order, leading to proper byte arrangement.

Little-Endian: In little-endian format, the least significant byte (LSB) is stored at the lowest memory address, while the most significant byte (MSB) is positioned at the highest memory address.

Big-Endian: Conversely, big-endian format places the most significant byte (MSB) at the lowest memory address, while the least significant byte (LSB) is located at the highest memory address.

<summary> Load, Add, and Store Instructions </summary>

Fundamental operations within computer architecture and assembly programming encompass Load, Add, and Store instructions, serving to manipulate data in memory and registers.

Illustrative Example: ``` ld x8, 16(x23) ```
In this instance:

* ``` ld ``` signifies the load double-word instruction.
* ``` x8 ``` denotes the destination register.
* ``` 16(x23) ``` designates the memory address indicated by register x23 (base address + offset).

<summary> Introduction to open-source simulator iverilog </summary>
	
Simulator
• RTL design is checked for adherence to the spec by simulating the design
• Simulator is the tool used for simulating the design
	• iverilog is the tool used for this course
Design
• Design is the actual Verilog code or set of Verilog codes which has the intended functionality to meet with the required specifications
TestBench
• TestBench is the setup to apply stimulus (test_vectors) to the design to check its functionality
How simulator works
• Simulator looks for the changes on the input signals
• Upon change to the input the output is evaluated
• If no change to the input, no change to the output
• Simulator is looking for change in the values of input

<summary> Introduction to Yosys and Logic synthesis </summary>
	
Synthesizer

• It is a tool used for converting RTL design code to netlist.

• Here, the synthesizer used is Yosys.

Yosys

• It is an open-source framework for Verilog RTL synthesis and formal verification.

• Yosys provides a collection of tools and algorithms that enable designers to transform high-level RTL (Register Transfer Level) descriptions of digital circuits into optimized gate-level representations suitable for physical implementation on hardware.

![image](https://github.com/shreyakotagal/pes_asic_class/assets/117657204/40e59198-1f35-43ea-b171-d7c4d8be52f9)


• Design and .lib files are fed to the synthesizer to get a netlist file.

• Netlist is the representation of the design in the form of standard cells in the .lib

Commands used to perform different opertions:

* read_verilog to read the design
* read_liberty to read the .lib file
* write_verilog to write out the netlist file
To verify the synthesis

![image](https://github.com/shreyakotagal/pes_asic_class/assets/117657204/623017a3-c5d8-4441-889c-c5bc25e8e6b5)

* Netlist along with the tesbench is fed to the iverilog simulator.
* The vcd file generated is fed to the gtkwave simulator.
* The output on the simulator must be same as the output observed during RTL simulation.
* Same RTL testbench can be used as the primary inputs and primary outputs remain same between the RTL design and synthesised netlist.

Logic Synthesis

* Logic synthesis is a process in digital design that transforms a high-level hardware description of a digital circuit, typically in a hardware description language (HDL) like Verilog or VHDL, into a lower-level representation composed of logic gates and flip-flops.
* The goal of logic synthesis is to optimize the design for various criteria such as performance, area, power consumption, and timing.

.lib

* It is a collection of logical modules like And, Or, Not etc.
* It has different flavors of same gate like 2 input AND gate, 3 input AND gate etc with different performace speed.

Why fast and slow version of same gate?
* Fast and slow versions of gates are essential in digital circuit design to balance between clock frequency and timing constraints.
* Fast gates have shorter propagation delays and are used to reduce setup and hold time violations, allowing for higher clock frequencies.
* Slow gates, with longer delays, can be used to intentionally slow down critical paths or address timing issues.
* The Tclk formula helps calculate the maximum clock frequency while considering these factors.

Tclk formula: 
![image](https://github.com/shreyakotagal/pes_asic_class/assets/117657204/99c06308-bea9-4d7b-94b2-f54527ec0acf)

* t_setup: The setup time is the minimum time before the clock edge when the input data must be stable.
* t_hold: The hold time is the minimum time after the clock edge during which the input data must remain stable.
* t_propagation: This term represents the propagation delay of the logic gates in the critical path.
* Tcq: This term represents the clock-to-q delay of the flip-flops or registers used in the design. It's often a fixed value based on the chosen flip-flop technology.
