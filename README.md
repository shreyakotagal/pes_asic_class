# PES_ASIC_Class
# OBJECTIVE

The objective of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) physical design for ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) is to convert a logical design description known as RTL (Register Transfer Level) into a physical arrangement suitable for fabrication as an integrated circuit. This process entails translating the circuit's abstract functional representation into a tangible implementation that satisfies design limitations, performance objectives, and the prerequisites for manufacturability.

# INSTALLATION

The following link was used to run the steps in the ubuntu terminal: https://github.com/kunalg123/riscv_workshop_collaterals/blob/master/run.sh

Errors that were come across:

```
shreyakotagal@Ubuntu:~/riscv_toolchain/iverilog$ ./configure checking build system type... x86_64-pc-linux-gnu checking host system type... x86_64-pc-linux-gnu checking for gcc... gcc checking whether the C compiler works... no configure: error: in `/home/shreyakotagal/riscv_toolchain/iverilog': configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables See `config.log' for more details
```

Restarting terminal and running the ./configure command again seemed to solve the issue.

# DAY 1

Program to find the sum from 1 to n numbers

```
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int i, sum=0, n=35;
	for (i=1;i<=n; ++i) {
	sum +=i;
	}
	printf("Sum of numbers from 1 to %d is %d \n",n,sum);
	return 0;
}

```
**using the gcc compiler**

**using RISC-V complier**

Initially the command 
``` riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -march=rv64i -mabi=lp64 -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c ``` threw an error

Adding the following commands and restarting terminal solved the error
``` 
export PATH=~/riscv_toolchain/riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-8.3.0-2019.08.0-x86_64-linux-ubuntu14/bin:$PATH
export PATH=~/riscv_toolchain/riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-8.3.0-2019.08.0-x86_64-linux-ubuntu14/riscv64-unknown-elf/bin:$PATH
```

```-O<number>``` : level of optimisation required

```-mabi``` : specifies the ABI (Application Binary Interface) to be used during code generation according to the requirements

```-march``` : specifies target architecture

**View the disassembled ALP code**

```riscv64-unkonwn-elf-objdump sum1ton.o```

While viewing the alp code, we need to look at the main section, to do so, we search ```\main``` till the correct section is found, use ```n``` to go further down to other "main". 

Here, since we used -O1 optimisation, the number of instructions are 15.

When we use -Ofast optimisation, we can see that the number of instructions have been reduced to 12.

**Debug the ALP generated by the compiler**

```spike -d pk sum1ton.o```
