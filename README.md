# PES_ASIC_Class
# OBJECTIVE

The objective of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) physical design for ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) is to convert a logical design description known as RTL (Register Transfer Level) into a physical arrangement suitable for fabrication as an integrated circuit. This process entails translating the circuit's abstract functional representation into a tangible implementation that satisfies design limitations, performance objectives, and the prerequisites for manufacturability.

# INSTALLATION

The following link was used to run the steps in the ubuntu terminal: https://github.com/kunalg123/riscv_workshop_collaterals/blob/master/run.sh

Errors that were come across:

```
shreyakotagal@Ubuntu:~/riscv_toolchain/iverilog$ ./configure checking build system type... x86_64-pc-linux-gnu checking host system type... x86_64-pc-linux-gnu checking for gcc... gcc checking whether the C compiler works... no configure: error: in `/home/shreyakotagal/riscv_toolchain/iverilog': configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables See `config.log' for more details
```

Restarting terminal and running the ./configure command again seemed to solve the issue.

<details> 
<summary> Application Binary Interface (ABI) Overview </summary>

An Application Binary Interface (ABI) constitutes a set of regulations that oversee the arrangement and access of functions, data structures, and system calls within a binary program or library. This framework establishes the fundamental interaction between distinct components of a program or between a program and the operating system. Noteworthy aspects of an ABI encompass:

1. Binary Harmony: ABIs ensure that binary code generated by one compiler or platform can harmonize seamlessly with code produced by another, provided they adhere to the same ABI specifications.

2. Function Calling Protocol: ABIs dictate the protocol for invoking functions, encompassing the sequence and location of arguments and return values, as well as the management of the call stack during function invocations.

3. Register Utilization: ABIs specify which registers are earmarked for specific purposes (e.g., argument passing, return values, temporary storage) and the manner in which they are managed during function calls.

4. Data Arrangement: ABIs outline the arrangement of data structures, such as structs and arrays, in memory, including guidelines for alignment and padding.

5. Exception Handling: They delineate the treatment of exceptions (e.g., hardware or software interrupts), encompassing the transition of control between user code and exception handlers.

6. System Calls: ABIs detail the manner in which programs interact with the operating system via system calls, including the mechanism for passing arguments and retrieving results.

7. Platform Neutrality: ABIs foster compatibility across distinct platforms (e.g., diverse CPU architectures or operating systems) by offering a standardized interface.

8. Dynamic Linking: They address dynamic linking aspects, including the loading and linking of shared libraries (DLLs on Windows or shared objects on Unix-based systems) during runtime.

9. Versioning: Certain ABIs incorporate mechanisms for versioning, enabling future modifications without disrupting compatibility with existing code.

10. Documentation: ABIs are typically documented and published, facilitating developers in crafting code that adheres to the ABI's specifications.

11. Toolchain Support: Compilers and assemblers are designed to produce code in accordance with the ABI, ensuring interoperability among code generated by varied tools.

12. Cross-Platform Development: ABIs hold special significance in cross-platform development, where code must execute on multiple platforms with potentially distinct hardware architectures and operating systems.

13. Security: ABIs may encompass security-related elements, such as safeguards against buffer overflows and stack vulnerabilities.

<summmary> Memory Allocation for Multi-Byte Values </summmary>

Storing a 64-bit number (or any multi-byte value) in memory necessitates awareness of byte order, leading to proper byte arrangement.

Little-Endian: In little-endian format, the least significant byte (LSB) is stored at the lowest memory address, while the most significant byte (MSB) is positioned at the highest memory address.

Big-Endian: Conversely, big-endian format places the most significant byte (MSB) at the lowest memory address, while the least significant byte (LSB) is located at the highest memory address.

<summary> Load, Add, and Store Instructions </summary>

Fundamental operations within computer architecture and assembly programming encompass Load, Add, and Store instructions, serving to manipulate data in memory and registers.

Illustrative Example: ``` ld x8, 16(x23) ```
In this instance:

* ``` ld ``` signifies the load double-word instruction.
* ``` x8 ``` denotes the destination register.
* ``` 16(x23) ``` designates the memory address indicated by register x23 (base address + offset).

Simulator
• RTL design is checked for adherence to the spec by simulating the design
• Simulator is the tool used for simulating the design
	• iverilog is the tool used for this course
Design
• Design is the actual Verilog code or set of Verilog codes which has the intended functionality to meet with the required specifications
TestBench
• TestBench is the setup to apply stimulus (test_vectors) to the design to check its functionality
How simulator works
• Simulator looks for the changes on the input signals
• Upon change to the input the output is evaluated
• If no change to the input, no change to the output
• Simulator is looking for change in the values of input

<summary> Introduction to Yosys and Logic synthesis </summary>
	
Synthesizer

• It is a tool used for converting RTL design code to netlist.

• Here, the synthesizer used is Yosys.

Yosys

• It is an open-source framework for Verilog RTL synthesis and formal verification.

• Yosys provides a collection of tools and algorithms that enable designers to transform high-level RTL (Register Transfer Level) descriptions of digital circuits into optimized gate-level representations suitable for physical implementation on hardware.

![image](https://github.com/shreyakotagal/pes_asic_class/assets/117657204/40e59198-1f35-43ea-b171-d7c4d8be52f9)


• Design and .lib files are fed to the synthesizer to get a netlist file.

• Netlist is the representation of the design in the form of standard cells in the .lib

Commands used to perform different opertions:

* read_verilog to read the design
* read_liberty to read the .lib file
* write_verilog to write out the netlist file
To verify the synthesis

![image](https://github.com/shreyakotagal/pes_asic_class/assets/117657204/623017a3-c5d8-4441-889c-c5bc25e8e6b5)

* Netlist along with the tesbench is fed to the iverilog simulator.
* The vcd file generated is fed to the gtkwave simulator.
* The output on the simulator must be same as the output observed during RTL simulation.
* Same RTL testbench can be used as the primary inputs and primary outputs remain same between the RTL design and synthesised netlist.

Logic Synthesis

* Logic synthesis is a process in digital design that transforms a high-level hardware description of a digital circuit, typically in a hardware description language (HDL) like Verilog or VHDL, into a lower-level representation composed of logic gates and flip-flops.
* The goal of logic synthesis is to optimize the design for various criteria such as performance, area, power consumption, and timing.

.lib

* It is a collection of logical modules like And, Or, Not etc.
* It has different flavors of same gate like 2 input AND gate, 3 input AND gate etc with different performace speed.

Why fast and slow version of same gate?
* Fast and slow versions of gates are essential in digital circuit design to balance between clock frequency and timing constraints.
* Fast gates have shorter propagation delays and are used to reduce setup and hold time violations, allowing for higher clock frequencies.
* Slow gates, with longer delays, can be used to intentionally slow down critical paths or address timing issues.
* The Tclk formula helps calculate the maximum clock frequency while considering these factors.

Tclk formula: 
![image](https://github.com/shreyakotagal/pes_asic_class/assets/117657204/99c06308-bea9-4d7b-94b2-f54527ec0acf)

* t_setup: The setup time is the minimum time before the clock edge when the input data must be stable.
* t_hold: The hold time is the minimum time after the clock edge during which the input data must remain stable.
* t_propagation: This term represents the propagation delay of the logic gates in the critical path.
* Tcq: This term represents the clock-to-q delay of the flip-flops or registers used in the design. It's often a fixed value based on the chosen flip-flop technology.

<summary> Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis </summary>

Hierarchical Synthesis:

* Hierarchical synthesis is an approach in digital design and logic synthesis where complex designs are broken down into smaller, more manageable modules or sub-circuits, and each module is synthesized individually.
* These synthesized modules are then integrated back into the overall design hierarchy.
* This approach helps manage the complexity of large designs and allows designers to work on different parts of the design independently.

* We use the module:  ``` multiple_modules.v ``` which lies in  ``` verilog_files ```

* Multiple_modules instantiates ``` sub_module1 ```  and ```  sub_module2 ```
* Launch yosys
* Read the library file ``` read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib ``` 
* Read the verilog file ``` read_verilog multiple_modules.v ```
*  ``` synth -top multiple_modules to set it as top module ```
*  ``` abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib ```
*  To view the netlist ``` show multiple_modules ```
*  ``` write_verilog -noattr multiple_modules_hier.v ```

<summary> Various Flop Coding Styles and optimization </summary>

<details> 
<summary> Why do we need a Flop? </summary>

* A flip-flop (often abbreviated as "flop") is a fundamental building block in digital circuit design.
* It's a type of sequential logic element that stores binary information (0 or 1) and can change its output based on clock signals and input values.
* In a combinational circuit, the output changes after the propagation delay of the circuit once inputs are changed.
* During the propagation of data, if there are different paths with different propagation delays, then a glitch might occur.
* There will be multiple glitches for multiple combinational circuits.
* Hence, we need flops to store the data from the combinational circuits.
* When a flop is used, the output of combinational circuit is stored in it and it is propagated only at the posedge or negedge of the clock so that the next combinational circuit gets a glitch free input thereby stabilising the output.
* We use control pins like set and reset to initialise the flops.
* They can be synchronous and asynchronous.

**D Flip-Flop with Asynchronous Reset**

When the reset is high, the output of the flip-flop is forced to 0, irrespective of the clock signal.
Else, on the positive edge of the clock, the stored value is updated at the output.

``` gvim dff_asyncres_syncres.v```

**D Flip_Flop with Asynchronous Set**

When the set is high, the output of the flip-flop is forced to 1, irrespective of the clock signal.
Else, on positive edge of the clock, the stored value is updated at the output.

``` gvim dff_async_set.v ```


**D Flip-Flop with Synchronous Reset**

When the reset is high on the positive edge of the clock, the output of the flip-flop is forced to 0.
Else, on the positive edge of the clock, the stored value is updated at the output.

``` gvim dff_syncres.v ```

**D Flip-Flop with Asynchronous Reset and Synchronous Reset**

When the asynchronous resest is high, the output is forced to 0.
When the synchronous reset is high at the positive edge of the clock, the output is forced to 0.
Else, on the positive edge of the clock, the stored value is updated at the output.
Here, it is a combination of both synchronous and asynchronous reset DFF.

``` gvim dff_asyncres_syncres.v ```

# Day 5

**Combinational and sequential optmizations**

<details>

<summary> Introduction to optimisation </summary>
<details> 
<summary> Combinational Optimisation </summary>

* Combinational logic refers to logic circuits where the outputs depend only on the current inputs and not on any previous states.
* Combinational optimization is a field of study in computer science and operations research that focuses on finding the best possible solution from a finite set of options for problems that involve discrete variables and have no inherent notion of time.
* Optimising the combinational logic circuit is squeezing the logic to get the most optimized digital design so that the circuit finally is area and power efficient.
Techniques for Optimisations:
* Constant propagation is an optimization technique used in compiler design and digital circuit synthesis to improve the efficiency of code and circuit implementations by replacing variables or expressions with their constant values where applicable.
* Boolean logic optimization, also known as logic minimization or Boolean function simplification, is a process in digital design that aims to simplify Boolean expressions or logic circuits by reducing the number of terms, literals, and gates required to implement a given logical function.
</details>

<details> 
<summary> Sequential Logic Optimisations </summary>

* Sequential logic optimizations involve improving the efficiency, performance, and resource utilization of digital circuits that include memory elements like flip-flops and latches.
* Optimizing sequential logic is crucial in ensuring that digital circuits meet timing requirements, consume minimal power, and occupy the least possible area while maintaining correct functionality.
Optimisation methods:
* Sequential constant propagation, also known as constant propagation across sequential elements, is an optimization technique used in digital design to identify and propagate constant values through sequential logic elements like flip-flops and registers. This technique aims to replace variable values with their known constant values at various stages of the logic circuit, optimizing the design for better performance and resource utilization.
* State optimization, also known as state minimization or state reduction, is an optimization technique used in digital design to reduce the number of states in finite state machines (FSMs) while preserving the original functionality.
* Sequential logic cloning, also known as retiming-based cloning or register cloning, is a technique used in digital design to improve the performance of a circuit by duplicating or cloning existing registers (flip-flops) and introducing additional pipeline stages.
* This technique aims to balance the critical paths within a circuit and reduce its overall clock period, leading to improved timing performance and better overall efficiency.
* Retiming is an optimization technique used in digital design to improve the performance of a circuit by repositioning registers (flip-flops) along its paths to balance the timing and reduce the critical path delay.
* The primary goal of retiming is to achieve a shorter clock period without changing the functionality of the circuit.

# Day 6

**GLS Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch and Blocking Non-blocking Statements**

<details> 
<summary> GLS Concepts And Flow Using Iverilog </summary>
	
**Gate Level Simualtion** 

* Gate-level simulation is a technique used in digital design and verification to validate the functionality of a digital circuit at the gate-level implementation.
* It involves simulating the circuit using the actual logic gates and flip-flops that make up the design, as opposed to higher-level abstractions like RTL (Register Transfer Level) descriptions.
* This type of simulation is typically performed after the logic synthesis process, where a high-level description of the design is transformed into a netlist of gates and flip-flops.
* We perform this to verify logical correctness of the design after synthesizing it.
* Also ensuring the timing of the design is met.

**Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch**

* A synthesis-simulation mismatch refers to a situation in digital design where the behavior of a circuit, as observed during simulation, doesn't match the expected or desired behavior of the circuit after it has been synthesized.
* This discrepancy can occur due to various reasons, such as timing issues, optimization conflicts, and differences in modeling between the simulation and synthesis tools.
* This mismatch is a critical concern in digital design because it indicates that the actual hardware implementation might not perform as expected, potentially leading to functional or timing failures in the fabricated chip.

**Blocking Statements**

* Blocking statements are executed sequentially in the order they appear in the code and have an immediate effect on signal assignments.
  
Example:

```
 module BlockingExample(input A, input B, input C, output Y, output Z);
  wire temp;

  // Blocking assignment
  assign temp = A & B;

  always @(posedge C) begin
      // Blocking assignment
      Y = temp;
      Z = ~temp;
  end
 endmodule
``` 
**Non-Blocking Statements**

* Non-blocking assignments are used to model concurrent signal updates, where all assignments are evaluated simultaneously and then scheduled to be updated at the end of the time step.

```
Example:
 module NonBlockingExample(input clock, input D, input reset, output reg Q);

 always @(posedge clock or posedge reset) begin
     if (reset)
         Q <= 0;  // Reset the flip-flop
     else
         Q <= D;  // Non-blocking assignment to update Q with D on clock edge
 end
endmodule
```

**Caveats with Blocking Statements**

* Blocking statements in hardware description languages like Verilog have their uses, but there are certain caveats and considerations to be aware of when working with them. Here are some important caveats associated with using blocking statements:
	* **Procedural Execution:** Blocking statements are executed sequentially in the order they appear within a procedural block (such as an always block). This can lead to unexpected behavior if the order of execution matters and is not well understood.
	* **Lack of Parallelism:** Blocking statements do not accurately represent the parallel nature of hardware. In hardware, multiple signals can update concurrently, but blocking statements model sequential behavior. As a result, using blocking statements for modeling complex concurrent logic can lead to incorrect simulations.
	* **Race Conditions:** When multiple blocking assignments operate on the same signal within the same procedural block, a race condition can occur. The outcome of such assignments depends on their order of execution, which might lead to inconsistent or unpredictable behavior.
	* **Limited Representation of Hardware:** Hardware systems are inherently concurrent and parallel, but blocking statements do not capture this aspect effectively. Using blocking assignments to model complex combinational or sequential logic can lead to models that are difficult to understand, maintain, and debug.

	* **Combinatorial Loops:** Incorrect use of blocking statements can lead to unintentional combinational logic loops, which can result in simulation or synthesis errors.

	* **Debugging Challenges:** Debugging code with many blocking assignments can be challenging, especially when trying to track down timing-related issues.

	* **Not Suitable for Flip-Flops:** Blocking assignments are not suitable for modeling flip-flop behavior. Non-blocking assignments (<=) are generally preferred for modeling flip-flop updates to ensure accurate representation of concurrent behavior.

	* **Sequential Logic Misrepresentation:** Using blocking assignments to model sequential logic might not capture the intended behavior accurately. Sequential elements like registers and flip-flops are better represented using non-blocking assignments.

	* **Synthesis Implications:** The behavior of blocking assignments might not translate well during synthesis, leading to potential mismatches between simulation and synthesis results.
